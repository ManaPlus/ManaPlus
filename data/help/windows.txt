##2SHORTCUT:

 To add an item to the shortcut bar click on the item in the inventory window,
 then click on the box in the shortcut-window which should be associated with
 the item. To reorder items within the shortcut-window simply click and drag
 them between the boxes. To remove items you simply drag them outside of the
 window and drop them.

 Currently only stackable items like food, but not weapons or clothes can be
 used with the shortcut window.
