1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out ManaPlus from Git or you have downloaded
a source release. To get ManaPlus to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* SDL_gfx           http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/software-mainmenu-14/4-ferzkopps-linux-software/19-sdlgfx
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

If you've cloned the Git repository, you will also need these tools to compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* GNU gettext       http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
* CVS               http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ (needed to run autopoint)

On some machines, it's been reported that this package is also needed. However,
you might not need it:

* GNU libtool       http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing ManaPlus
====================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you've cloned the Git repository, run "autoreconf -i" to generate
   configure and install any missing auxiliary files.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed ManaPlus on your system now, and you can run it
with "manaplus". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can pass
a different prefix to configure as usual.


  NOTE: It is possible to compile ManaPlus without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".
