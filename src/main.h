 *
 * \section Introduction Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for the Mana client (http://manasource.org). It is
 * always a work in progress, with the intent to make it easier for new
 * developers to grow familiar with the source code.
 *
 * \section General General information
 *
 * During the game, the current Map is displayed by the main Viewport, which
 * is the bottom-most widget in the WindowContainer. Aside the viewport, the
 * window container keeps track of all the \link Window Windows\endlink
 * displayed during the game. It is the <i>top</i> widget for Guichan.
 *
 * A Map is composed of several layers of \link Image Images\endlink (tiles),
 * a layer with collision information and \link Sprite Sprites\endlink. The
 * sprites define the visible part of \link Being Beings\endlink and
 * \link FloorItem FloorItems\endlink, they are drawn from top to bottom
 * by the map, interleaved with the tiles in the fringe layer.
 *
 * The client supports two servers, \link EAthena eAthena\endlink (the TMW
 * version) and the \link ManaServ Mana server\endlink. To achieve this, the
 * \link Net network communication layer\endlink is abstracted in many
 * different interfaces, which have different implementations for each server.
